# Classification-of-musical-genres-and-music-retrival
revision in progress

During the project for the DIGITAL SIGNAL IMAGE MANAGEMENT course I learned how to manage and process audio and image files. The aim of the project was the classification, through machine learning and deep learning models, of musical genres by extracting specific audio features from the "gtzan dataset" dataset files with which to train the models (SVM, Linear Regression, Decision tree , rhabdom Forest, Neural Network). Mel spectograms were also extracted to train convolutional neural network models.
