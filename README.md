# Classification-of-musical-genres-and-music-retrival

Authors: Dario Della Mura - David Doci

During the project for the DIGITAL SIGNAL IMAGE MANAGEMENT course I learned how to manage and process audio and image files. The aim of the project was the classification, through machine learning and deep learning models, of musical genres by extracting specific audio features from the "gtzan dataset" dataset files with which to train the models (SVM, Linear Regression, Decision tree , Random Forest, Neural Network). Mel spectograms were also extracted to train convolutional neural network models (CNN).

In addition, the extracted audio features have been used to develop a model of music retrieval which given an audio track in input produces as output 5 audio tracks recommended meiante the use of cousine similarity.
